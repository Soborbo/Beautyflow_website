        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">
          How does diode laser hair removal work?
        </h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The principle behind laser hair removal is quite simple: the device emits a special light that is absorbed by the pigment (melanin) in the hair shaft.
          This light converts to heat and burns the hair follicle, which then either stops producing new hair entirely or produces much thinner, weaker hair.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          It's important to understand that the laser can only affect hairs that are in an active growth phase,
          because it's the hair shaft itself that absorbs and transfers heat to the hair follicle.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          This is why multiple treatments on the same area are necessary—so that the laser can eventually reach hairs
          that weren't visible during earlier sessions.
        </p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <strong>Image 2:</strong> When we direct the laser beam at the hair, the heat energy is absorbed by the melanin, which heats up the rest of the hair shaft as well.

          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <strong>Image 3:</strong> The heat either weakens or completely destroys the hair follicle. As a result, the follicle separates from the hair shaft.

          <p class="text-gray-700">
            <strong>Image 4:</strong> The hair falls out, and since the follicle is no longer present, hair cannot regrow in that area.

          Why is it important to use a three-wavelength device?
        </h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          This is probably a question most people don't understand at first—but your treatment's success may depend on the answer!
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          In diode laser hair removal treatments, wavelength refers to treatment depth—how far beneath the skin's surface the device can reach the hair follicles.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Since hair follicles can be found at various depths (650-1060nm) depending on your body type and the treatment area,
          single-wavelength devices often don't provide fully satisfactory results. These are calibrated to 808 nanometers,
          meaning they simply cannot reach many hair follicles that are closer to the surface or deeper.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The Lumino 1200 laser hair removal technology was developed to treat hair follicles at every depth,
          so no hairs remain simply because they're located higher or deeper than 808nm.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The other reason I definitely recommend multi-wavelength devices is the skin tone factor.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          While the 808 nanometer laser can technically treat all skin types, its effectiveness isn't the same across the board.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          For light skin, for example, our experience shows that the 755 nanometer wavelength works best,
          while for darker skin tones, 1064 nanometers produces the best results. Single-wavelength devices are set between these two,
          which in practice doesn't mean they work well for both—rather, they're not truly optimal for either.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          Our devices have all three wavelengths built into a single handpiece, so every skin color and hair type can be treated with perfect efficiency.
        </p>

          How long-lasting is laser hair removal?
        </h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Understandably, this is one of the most common questions, since laser hair removal isn't cheap and no one wants to waste time and money on a half-solution.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The good news is that diode laser effects really do last long-term—even if not forever.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          By the end of the treatment series (6–12 sessions depending on individual factors), approximately 80–90% of your hair will actually disappear,
          and what remains will be much thinner and lighter, plus it grows back much slower. This alone is a huge achievement.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Especially since for most people, the effects last for years and you don't have to seriously deal with hair removal.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          The human body naturally changes and regenerates continuously, so some hair may return,
          but after the initial series, 1–3 maintenance treatments per year are more than enough to keep your skin continuously smooth and inflammation-free.

          Can blonde hair be treated with diode laser?
        </h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Unfortunately, the short answer is: not really.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          As I mentioned earlier, the diode laser targets the pigment (melanin) in the hair shaft.
          The more melanin in a hair shaft, the darker it is, the better it absorbs light, and the more effectively the laser can damage the hair follicle.
          This is why the method works so well on dark hair with light skin.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          However, the situation is completely different with blonde, red, or gray hair: these contain very little melanin,
          so the laser can't really reach the hair follicles, which drastically reduces effectiveness.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          For blonde hair, electrolysis may be a better method, as it targets the hair follicle directly rather than the pigment.
          This is slower and more meticulous, but for blonde hair, it's often the only lasting solution.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">
          What's the difference between IPL hair removal and diode laser hair removal?
        </h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          At first glance, IPL and diode laser hair removal may seem very similar, since both use light energy to damage hair follicles—the difference lies in the type of light and the treatment results.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          IPL (Intense Pulsed Light) means flash light hair removal. In this case, a broad-spectrum, scattered light reaches the skin,
          the hair's melanin converts this light into heat, and some of that heat reaches the hair follicle.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          But IPL is much less concentrated than diode laser hair removal—it damages the hair follicle but doesn't eliminate it,
          so the results are less dramatic: it can only thin and slow hair growth, not completely stop it.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The diode laser, on the other hand, is targeted and penetrates much deeper into the skin. The laser precisely targets individual hairs,
          which conduct its energy as heat into the hair follicle.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Diode laser hair removal is much more precise, therefore much more powerful, longer-lasting, and more effective.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          By the end of the treatment series, 80–90% of hairs completely disappear and the remainder becomes thinner and lighter.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          You'll feel the difference in your daily life too: with IPL, you'll need more treatments and more frequent maintenance sessions,
          while with diode laser, one intensive course is enough followed by 1-3 reminder treatments per year.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          So compared to diode laser hair removal, IPL is cheaper but less effective, promising only temporary results.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed font-semibold mb-8">
          If you want long-term results, the diode laser is clearly the more effective and longer-lasting technology.
