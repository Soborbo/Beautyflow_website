    questions: [
      {
        q: "What is a diode laser and how does it differ from other laser types?",
        a: "A diode laser is a laser technology that operates at 808 nm wavelength and is excellent for targeted treatment of hair follicles. Compared to other lasers (alexandrite, Nd:YAG), diode laser is more effective at treating melanin-rich hair while being gentler on the skin. The professional diode laser devices used at Beautyflow salons feature the latest cooling technology, making the treatment more comfortable."
      },
      {
        q: "How many treatments are needed for lasting results?",
        a: "Generally, 6-10 treatments are needed for lasting results, at 4-6 week intervals. The number of sessions depends on the size of the treated area, hair density and color, and individual hormonal status. After completing the treatments, 1-2 maintenance sessions per year are recommended."
      },
      {
        q: "Is laser hair removal painful?",
        a: "Modern diode laser devices have built-in cooling systems that significantly reduce discomfort. Most patients experience a mild stinging or warm sensation. Sensitivity varies between individuals, but the treatment is generally well-tolerated. Numbing cream can be applied if needed."
      },
      {
        q: "What skin types is the treatment suitable for?",
        a: "Diode laser hair removal is suitable for almost all skin types, from light to darker skin tones (Fitzpatrick I-V). The most effective results are achieved with dark hair and lighter skin, but modern devices can be safely used on darker skin as well. The treatment is less effective on blonde, red, or gray hair."
      },
      {
        q: "What should I do before and after the treatment?",
        a: "Before treatment: Avoid sun exposure and self-tanners for 2 weeks, don't epilate or wax for 4 weeks, shave the hair 24 hours before the treatment. After treatment: Avoid sun exposure and use sunscreen, don't use saunas or hot baths for 48 hours, avoid intense exercise for 24 hours, and moisturize the skin regularly."
      },
      {
        q: "Are there any side effects of the treatment?",
        a: "Laser hair removal is generally a safe procedure. Temporary side effects may include mild redness, swelling, or sensitivity, which usually subside within a few hours. In rare cases, pigmentation changes or blistering may occur, so professional treatment and following aftercare advice are important."
      },
      {
        q: "How often should treatments be repeated?",
        a: "Treatments are generally performed every 4-6 weeks, following the hair growth cycle. For the face, more frequent intervals (3-4 weeks) are recommended, while for the body, longer intervals (5-6 weeks) are advised. After completing the treatment series, 1-2 maintenance sessions per year are sufficient."
      },
      {
        q: "When will I see results?",
        a: "Initial results are visible after just 1-2 treatments: hair becomes thinner and sparser. The treated hairs fall out 1-3 weeks after the treatment. Lasting results are achieved after completing the full treatment series (6-10 sessions)."
      },
      {
        q: "Can the treatment be done during pregnancy or breastfeeding?",
        a: "We do not recommend laser hair removal during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Although there is no evidence that it is harmful, following the principle of caution and due to hormonal changes, it is advisable to postpone the treatment."
      },
      {
        q: "Can the treatment be done on intimate areas?",
        a: "Yes, treatment of intimate areas (bikini line, Brazilian, full intimate) is popular and safe. The cooling system of modern devices is especially important in these sensitive areas. Our specialists perform the treatment discreetly and professionally."
      },
      {
        q: "Can men also use this service?",
        a: "Absolutely! Laser hair removal is increasingly popular among men. Common areas include: back, shoulders, chest, abdomen, and face (beard line). Men's hair is generally thicker, so a few extra treatments may be needed."
      },
      {
        q: "How much does laser hair removal cost?",
        a: "Prices depend on the size of the treated area. Smaller areas (underarms, upper lip) start from a few thousand forints, larger areas (full legs, back) are more expensive. We offer significant discounts with our package deals. For exact prices, visit our Prices page or request a personalized quote."
      },
      {
        q: "Can the treatment be done over a tattoo?",
        a: "Laser hair removal CANNOT be performed over a tattoo because the laser may target the ink, which can cause burns or discoloration of the tattoo. Tattooed areas must be avoided during the treatment."
      },
      {
        q: "Is it safe around moles and freckles?",
        a: "Moles and other pigmented skin lesions must be avoided during treatment. Before the laser treatment, our specialist will assess your skin and mark the areas to avoid. For large or suspicious moles, dermatological consultation is recommended."
      },
      {
        q: "What happens if I miss a treatment?",
        a: "Missing one session does not significantly affect the results, but regular treatment is more effective. If you take a longer break, hair growth may restart, and more follow-up treatments may be needed. Try to maintain the recommended 4-6 week interval."

    questions: [
      {
        q: "How does laser tattoo removal work?",
        a: "During laser tattoo removal, the laser uses high-energy light pulses to break down ink particles in the skin into tiny pieces. These particles are then naturally removed by the body's immune system over the following weeks. The treatment is a safe and effective way to remove unwanted tattoos."
      },
      {
        q: "How many treatments are needed to remove a tattoo?",
        a: "The number of treatments needed depends on the size, color, depth, and age of the tattoo. Generally, 6-12 treatments are required, at 6-8 week intervals. Amateur tattoos fade faster, while professional, colored tattoos require more treatments."
      },
      {
        q: "Is tattoo removal painful?",
        a: "The treatment involves some discomfort; many compare the sensation to a rubber band snapping against the skin. Modern lasers have cooling systems that reduce pain. For larger areas or more sensitive patients, numbing cream can be applied."
      },
      {
        q: "What color tattoos can be removed?",
        a: "Black and dark blue tattoos are the easiest to remove. Green, light blue, and purple colors require more treatments. Yellow, orange, and white colors are the most difficult. With modern multiwave lasers, almost all colors can be treated."
      },
      {
        q: "Will there be scarring after the treatment?",
        a: "With professional treatment and proper aftercare, the risk of scarring is minimal. The laser targets the ink, not the skin. It is important to allow adequate healing time between treatments and follow expert instructions."
      },
      {
        q: "When will I see results?",
        a: "Tattoo fading occurs gradually, treatment by treatment. The first significant change is usually visible after 2-3 treatments. After each treatment, the body works for 6-8 weeks to remove the ink particles."
      },
      {
        q: "Is there recovery time after the treatment?",
        a: "Redness, swelling, and blistering may occur in the treated area for 1-2 weeks - this is a normal reaction. The area may be sensitive for 2-4 weeks. Avoid sun exposure, swimming, and intense sports during healing."
      },
      {
        q: "Can permanent makeup be removed?",
        a: "Yes, permanent makeup (eyebrows, eyelids, lips) can also be removed with laser, but these require special treatment due to the sensitivity of the area. It's important to know that certain permanent makeup pigments may oxidize and darken at the first treatment."
      },
      {
        q: "Can a fresh tattoo be removed?",
        a: "We recommend starting treatment of a fresh tattoo at least 6-8 weeks after the tattoo was done, so the skin can fully heal. New tattoos are often easier to remove because the ink has not penetrated as deeply."
      },
      {
        q: "How much does tattoo removal cost?",
        a: "The price depends on the size of the tattoo. Treatment of smaller tattoos (e.g., 5x5 cm) costs approximately 15-25 thousand forints per session, larger areas are proportionally more expensive. We offer better prices with package deals."

      {
        q: "What is permanent makeup?",
        a: "Permanent makeup (cosmetic tattooing) is a cosmetic tattooing technique that results in natural-looking, long-lasting makeup. Special pigments applied to the upper layers of the skin can enhance eyebrows, eyes, and lips. The results last 1-3 years and then gradually fade."

      },
      {
        q: "Is permanent makeup painful?",
        a: "We apply numbing cream before the treatment, so pain is minimal. Most people feel a slight scratching or pressure sensation. Sensitivity varies between individuals; the sensation may be more intense for lips and eyelids."
      },
      {
        q: "How long does permanent makeup last?",
        a: "Duration varies between 1-3 years, depending on skin type, the technique applied, pigment color, and lifestyle. It fades faster on oilier skin. A touch-up treatment is recommended once a year to maintain perfect results."
      },
      {
        q: "What is the healing process like?",
        a: "Healing takes 7-14 days. In the first few days, the color will be more intense, then scabs form and gradually fall off. The final color and shape are visible after 4-6 weeks. Important: do not scratch or soak the area during healing!"
      },
      {
        q: "Is a touch-up required?",
        a: "Yes, a touch-up treatment is recommended 4-6 weeks after the first treatment. This is part of the process and is usually included in the price. During the touch-up, we refine the shape, replace any pigment that may have fallen out, and finalize the result."
      },
      {
        q: "Am I suitable for permanent makeup?",
        a: "Permanent makeup is suitable for most people. Contraindications include: pregnancy, breastfeeding, diabetes, blood clotting disorders, epilepsy, active skin conditions, and tendency to keloid scarring. We assess suitability during the consultation."
      },
      {
        q: "How do I choose the right shape and color?",
        a: "During the consultation, our specialist considers your face shape, skin tone, eye color, and personal preferences. Before the tattoo, we draw the shape so you can see and approve it. The color fades by 30-40% after healing."
      },
      {
        q: "Can I apply makeup to my eyebrows after the treatment?",
        a: "Avoid applying makeup to the treated area during healing (7-14 days). After that, you can apply makeup, but the point of permanent makeup is that you'll need little to no makeup. Many people only add to it on special occasions."
      },
      {
        q: "What happens if I don't like the result?",
        a: "The thorough pre-treatment consultation and preliminary shape drawing minimize this risk. If you are still dissatisfied, we can make adjustments during the touch-up appointment. As a last resort, permanent makeup can be removed with laser, although this is a time-consuming process."

        q: "What is the healing process like?",
        a: "Temporary darkening followed by scab formation is expected in the treated area. The scab naturally falls off within 7-14 days, revealing new, healthy skin underneath. Important: do not pick at the scab and use sunscreen!"
      },
      {
        q: "Can pigmentation spots come back?",
        a: "Successfully removed pigmentation spots generally do not return, BUT new spots can develop due to sun exposure or hormonal changes. The key to prevention is: regular use of sunscreen (SPF 30+) and avoiding excessive sun exposure."
      },
      {
        q: "Can it be done on any skin type?",
        a: "The treatment is safest and most effective on lighter skin types (Fitzpatrick I-III). On darker skin, there is a higher risk of hypopigmentation (light spots), so more cautious settings are required. We assess suitability during consultation."
      },
      {
        q: "Can melasma be treated with laser?",
        a: "Melasma is a complex problem where laser treatment is only one element of comprehensive therapy. It can be effective for some types, but may worsen others. For melasma, expert consultation and a personalized treatment plan are definitely required."
      },
      {
        q: "When is the best time for treatment?",
        a: "The autumn-winter months are ideal for pigmentation treatment when sun intensity is lower. It can also be done in summer with increased sun protection, but the risk of re-pigmentation is higher."
      },
      {
        q: "What should I do before and after the treatment?",
        a: "Before treatment: avoid sun exposure and self-tanners for 2-4 weeks. After treatment: use sunscreen (SPF 50), avoid direct sunlight, don't scratch, and moisturize regularly. Our specialist will explain the exact protocol."
